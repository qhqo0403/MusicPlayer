Cold Inside

When you lose your time
You think it will be enough
In a cage of your life
Someday it will make you laugh.

I can’t deny
That I would find
A way to fight
My innocence
Is my defense

When I go on again,
Even you say I can do what I want if it makes me die
This cold night I'm cold inside
I want it all this night

Praying down on my knees
I'm asking myself and God
Why I lost in tears
Of enveloping evil fog.

Criminal

I'm on the edge of a skyscraper
Counting the stars like city lights
I don't know where I'll end up later
Maybe lost in the ashes
Lost in the ashes

I'm running I'm running
I'm running I'm running
I'm running from myself

Everywhere I go
In these busy streets
Imma criminal
Every day and night
Moving slow mo in the
Fast life

Oooh... Imma Criminal

Blood on my hands, fighting my demons
It's a war zone inside this jungle
Trouble follows everywhere I'm moving
Call me a savage,
Call me a savage

I'm running I'm running
I'm running I'm running
I'm running from myself

Everywhere I go
In these busy streets
Imma criminal
Every day and night
Moving slow mo in the
Fast life

Pain(t) On You

Verse 1

Sing to me, tell me that I’m not the one

Not just any song, I’ll let you be the swan

You know my secrets, you know my fears

I feel how I’m evicted, I’m trapped in all your tears

I’m in every word your lips are shaping

And it’s in your silence, that I’m slowly fading

So before you go, before questions stay unanswered

Sculpt me brutally, until I’m truly battered



Chorus



Make of me your work of art

Adorn my soul, decorate my heart

Don’t be afraid, please, just feel free

To put paint on me

Put pain on me...



Verse 2



Cover up the harm, cover up your shame

As long as you can’t see it, it will be the same

Eyes so easy to deceive, but deep inside you’ll know

That’s just surface colour, cause the dark can’t glow

You’ll see the mud, you’ll see the dirt

There’s no escape, your path was curt

And in the end, if we go back to the start

You’ll realize that maybe, you’re the “work of art”

Blind girl

Remember all those times
that you were happy
she was always next to you
and all the times that you were crying
she was the friend
you could hold on to

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Always lurking in my dreams
you 're the bad witch
that wants to win
hurting me and laughing loud
i tried to make you see the truth
till now

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Hurting me
and laughing loud
i tried to make you see the truth
till now

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold
your inner voice is being hammered
in your mind's forest you 're lost

Blind girl your eyes are covered
blind girl your soul is cold.

work n play

[Verse 1]
First, tell me how you feel, don't say you fine
We back and forth, every time, outta line
But I'm lying if I say we don't got the time
It ain't my fault, ain't my fault
It’s a blind spot or a state of mind?
Can’t even tell the difference if you real or when you lying
I be doubting all the benefits, but fuck it I don’t mind
I’ll handle the shit like my overall 99
Inadvertently you be hurting me no cap
The curtain close, the lights dim, it's a steel trap
You can’t tell me you don’t do that shit
You can’t be on the gram “new phone, who dis?” huh
I know to you it’s probably something light
And then again that’s probably why we fight, but I ignore it
Separating all the lies just to see if we can vibe
I’ll be waiting outside saying baby we’ll be fine

[Chrous]
There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

[Verse 2]
Storytelling hereditary, I fill the void
I make space at my own pace, I don't wait
I’m on point, I’m all for it, It’s nothing new
Saying it’s a hobby nigga, this is all I fucking do
Hate when niggas say they understand, you don’t understand
How I got a fuckin' degree inside of my father's crib
When’s ya boy gonna do it? When’s he gonna win
When’s he gonna have his girl not question where he live?
The path I take, yeah, I know I got a choice
My mom off it, off topic, it’s all love
My girl with it, she see the vision, it’s all love
Funny how love can be a love that’s not enough
Funny how a buzz can suddenly make you give a fuck
Funny how I got to where I am when I did enough
Funny how you don't understand til want something
But you ain't gonna say that

But you ain't gonna say that

Separating all the lies just to see if we can vibe
I’ll be waiting outside saying baby we’ll be fine

[Chrous]
There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play
